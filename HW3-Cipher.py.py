#  Description:Cryptography is an ancient study of secret writing.
#  There is a wealth of literature in this field.
#  An extremely readable book on this subject is The Code Book by Simon Singh.
#  This is a field of study that is of particular relevance in Computer Science.
#  Given the widespread use of computers,
#  one of the things people are interested in is making transactions over the internet more secure.
#  Here is a simple and clever way to encrypt plain text.
#  We Assume that the message contains only upper case letters,
#  lower case letters and digits. Let L be the length of the original message,
#  And M the smallest square number greater than or equal to L.
#  We add (M-L) asterisks to the message, giving a padded message with length M.
#  Then we use the padded message to fill a table of size K x K, where K2 = M.
#  We fill the table in row-major order (left to right in each column, top to bottom for each row).
#  Now to encrypt, rotate the table 90Â° clockwise.
#  The encrypted message comes from reading the message in row-major order from the rotated table,
#  omitting any asterisks and maintaining the case of each character from the original message.
